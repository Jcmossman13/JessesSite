    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/793930071060967424/GTCRmQwb_400x400.jpg">
    <p>My name is Jesse Mossman. I am originally from the state of Nebraska. I just moved to Washington three weeks ago. I like to play Xbox in my free time.</p>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>After high school I worked as a security guard for two years. I then moved to Manhattan, KS and found a job at Wal-Mart. I joined Coder Camps on May 2, 2017. I am currently working on Coding from scratch.</p>
    <h3>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h3>
    <p>I decided to learn programming because my dream has been to work for Microsoft. I was told the easiest way to get my foot in the door is to learn how to code. Hopefully, learning how to program will grant my dreams true.</p>
